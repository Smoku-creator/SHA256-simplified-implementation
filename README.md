# SHA256-simplified-implementation

The project consists of a simplified SHA256 hash calculator for strings not exceeding one message block - consistent with the standard.
A testbench has been provided giving an insight into the calculation process, without assertions - so that the programmer can take a look into ongoing subprocesses without worrying of the testbench stopping upon discovering an error. Future testbenches will involve automatic data injections and assertions for sanity check's sake.
